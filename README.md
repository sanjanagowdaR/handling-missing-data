Handling missing data is a critical step in data cleaning and preparation. Missing data can arise from various reasons, such as incomplete data entry, system errors, or non-responses in surveys. How you handle it depends on the nature of the data, the percentage of missing values, and the intended analysis.

Types of Missing Data
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):

Missingness is unrelated to the data itself.
Example: A sensor randomly fails to record temperature.
Approach: Simple imputation or removal may work since there's no bias.
MAR (Missing at Random):

Missingness depends on observed data, not the missing data itself.
Example: High-income individuals are less likely to disclose income.
Approach: Imputation using relationships with other variables.
MNAR (Missing Not at Random):

Missingness depends on the missing data itself.
Example: People with high debt avoid reporting financial details.
Approach: This is challenging and often requires domain knowledge or modeling.
